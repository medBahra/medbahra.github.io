title: Training  related to MOSIP (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) source code
description: >
  Gained hands-on experience with the MOSIP architecture by exploring and analyzing its open-source codebase. Focused on understanding the registration and authentication modules, data flow, and integration points. Contributed to debugging and customizing core components, with particular attention to identity lifecycle management, security layers, and modular service design. This experience strengthened my skills in working with large-scale, government-grade digital identity platforms.
