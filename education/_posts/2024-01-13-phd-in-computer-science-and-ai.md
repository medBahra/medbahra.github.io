title: Ph.D in computer science and AI
description: >
  Pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence has been a transformative journey marked by curiosity, resilience, and a deep passion for innovation. From the early stages of research to publishing and defending my work, I was driven by a desire to solve real-world problems through intelligent systems. The experience challenged me to think critically, collaborate across disciplines, and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI. More than just an academic achievement, this journey shaped the way I approach problem-solving and solidified my commitment to building impactful, ethical, and forward-thinking technology.
