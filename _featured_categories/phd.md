  I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence from Abdelmalek Essaâdi University in Tétouan, Morocco. My research focused on applying AI to real-world challenges, particularly in sentiment analysis, natural language processing, and big data analytics. Throughout my doctoral work, I published several peer-reviewed papers covering key topics such as fake news detection using fuzzy logic and neural networks, ontology-based sentiment analysis in the context of Brexit, and public sentiment analysis on recycled water in smart cities. My approach combined machine learning, text mining, and statistical methods to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. With over 2,600 reads and more than 30 citations, I am proud to contribute to advancing the field of AI with work that is both academically rigorous and socially relevant.
